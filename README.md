# Multi-Source Multi-Agent Finance Assistant

A powerful finance assistant that leverages multiple AI agents to provide comprehensive financial information and insights from various sources.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](arch.jpg)

The system is built using a multi-agent architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Orchestrator**
   - Manages communication between different agents
   - Handles request routing and response aggregation
   - Built with FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints

2. **Agents**
   - **Voice Agent**: Handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions
   - **API Agent**: Interfaces with financial APIs (e.g., yfinance)
   - **Retriever Agent**: Manages document retrieval and processing
   - **Scraping Agent**: Extracts financial information from web sources

3. **Data Ingestion**
   - Handles data collection and preprocessing
   - Supports multiple data sources and formats

4. **Streamlit Frontend**
   - User-friendly web interface
   - Real-time interaction with the multi-agent system
   - Voice input/output capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Google Cloud API credentials (for Gemini AI)

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-source-multi-agent-finance-assistant.git
cd multi-source-multi-agent-finance-assistant
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
# Start the orchestrator
uvicorn orchestrator.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t finance-assistant .
```

2. Run the container:
